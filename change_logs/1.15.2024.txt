1/15/24 Changelog:

I haven't done a change log in a long time, so I thought I would update with the recent progress.
I've added a ton of new powers, just so the game can be more dumb.
I've added tons of synergies related to capitalism, glasses, and just random ideas I've had. 
I've also introduced a new anti-synergy system, where you can get synergies based on the opponents powers. 
I think the anti-synergies are really cool, but I don't have many ideas for them, so there's only like 10.
Lastly, I've realized that the whole random thing doesn't work, I believe because of bad coding. I have them diabled for now, but to be honest I don't know what to do.
